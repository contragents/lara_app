To check how this stuff works you can visit http://xn--d1aiwkc2d.club:8000/ .
There are links for two Jobs dispatching. 
One Job lasts for 60 seconds and another one lasts for 30 seconds.
On the main page you can monitor the state of Jobs' Queue by refreshing the page.

The task:
We need to implement a custom queue management module in the Laravel framework.
No 3rd party libraries should be used.
For this we should have a Queue manager class that will provide a functional API for adding tasks to the queue. 
Tasks should be executed asynchronously. 
The System should allow implementing custom tasks as PHP classes. 
You could use Mysql as a database and Linux commands.
As an example please provide 2 controllers that are creating 2 different test tasks.
There should be another controller that is displaying a table with the tasks in the queue with the corresponding statuses.
