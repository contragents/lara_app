We need to implement a custom queue management module in the Laravel framework.
No 3rd party libraries should be used.
For this we should have a Queue manager class that will provide a functional API for adding tasks to the queue. 
Tasks should be executed asynchronously. 
The System should allow implementing custom tasks as PHP classes. 
You could use Mysql as a database and Linux commands.
As an example please provide 2 controllers that are creating 2 different test tasks.
There should be another controller that is displaying a table with the tasks in the queue with the corresponding statuses.
